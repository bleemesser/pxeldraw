This app uses MongoDB, so you will need to have that installed to run the site.
## Setup:
Clone the repo to a folder. ```cd``` into the frontend and backend directories and for both run ```npm install```.
In /frontend run ```npm start``` to launch the dev server. To create a production build, run ```npm run build``` and ```serve -s build```.
In /backend run ```node server.js```
